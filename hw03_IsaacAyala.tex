\section{Problem}
Let A and B be two events in the sample space S. 
Show that if $P(A) $ and $P(B)$ are
non-zero, then A and B cannot be mutually exclusive and independent.

\section{Proof}

From \cite{stewart2009probability} we observe that for events A and B to be independent then

\begin{equation}
 P(A \cap B) = P(A) P(B)
\end{equation}

Recall that for two events to be mutually exclusive then

\begin{equation}
 P(A \cap B) = 0
\end{equation}

Thus for two events to be independent and mutually exclusive at the same time then $P(A) P(B) = 0$.
The problem states that both $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are non-zero, hence we conclude that A and B \emph{cannot} be mutually exclusive and independent at the same time because $P(A\cap B)  \neq 0$.
